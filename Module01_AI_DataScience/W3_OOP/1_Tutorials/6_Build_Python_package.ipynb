    "## Step 1: Installing Poetry\n",
    "Poetry is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python. It provides a simple way to build and publish Python packages.\n",
    "### Installing pipx\n",
    "Poetry can be installed using pipx. If you don't have pipx installed, you can install it using the following command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "py -m pip install --user pipx\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Installing Poetry\n",
    "Once pipx is installed, you can install Poetry with the following command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pipx install poetry\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Verifying the Installation\n",
    "To verify that Poetry is installed correctly, run the following command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "poetry --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "You should see an output similar to `Poetry (version 1.8.2)`."

    "```bash\n",
    "poetry new aio2024\n",
